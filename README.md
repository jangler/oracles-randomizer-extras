# Oracles Randomizer Extras

<https://jangler.github.io/oracles-randomizer-extras/>

Logic-less customizations that can be applied to an Oracles ROM
post-randomization. See <https://github.com/jangler/oracles-randomizer> for the
main randomizer.

## Why a separate project?

Four different forks of the randomizer are commonly used. Creating a separate
layer for these add-ons allows using the with all compatible forks without
requiring them to each merge the changes. Plus, I needed to build my webtech
portfolio.

## Build instructions

You'll need `make` and `npm`. Just run:

    $ make
